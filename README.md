A minimal and (soon to be) universal routing engine using [redux][redux],
[uniloc][uniloc], and the HTML5 history api. Inspired by
[@james_k_nelson][james-k-nelson]'s
[Simple Routing with Redux and React][redux-routing] and
[@agamennon][guilherme]'s [redux-tiny-router][redux-tiny-router].

It treats routing as simple state, stored in Redux and made available to
components via Redux's `connect()` wrapper. Manage your components however you
want using the route data generated by [uniloc][uniloc]. Use the included
`<Link/>` component to generate urls from route names and options (often
referred to as "reverse lookup"), and trigger routing events when users click
your links.

## Install

```
npm install --save unirouter redux
```

Redux is the only hard peer dependency, but if you want to use the `<Link/>`
component you'll need to install React as well:

```
# Optional
npm install --save react
```

## Initialize

Before you can use unirouter, you'll need to include the provided reducer in
your combined redux reducer:

```js
import {combineReducers, createStore} from 'redux'
import myReducer from '../path/to/my/reducer'
import unirouterReducer from 'unirouter/reducer'

const reducer = combineReducers({
  router: unirouterReducer,
  myStuff: myReducer,
})

let store = createStore(reducer)
```

You'll also need to call the `init()` function to set up your initial routing
information and establish event hooks for the HTML5 history api:

```js
import init from 'unirouter/init'
import getMyStore from '../path/to/my/store'

const store = getMyStore()

const routes = {
  listContacts: 'GET /contacts',
  postContact: 'POST /contacts',
  editContact: 'GET /contacts/:id',
}

const aliases = {
  'GET /': 'listContacts',
}

init(store, routes, aliases)
```

This is best done in your init script on the front end, or in your render
middleware on the server.

## Use

### Route State

If the user were to come in with the url `/contacts/13/edit?details=true`, the
following state would be available using whatever key you passed to the
`combineReducers()` call mentioned above:

```js
{name: 'editContact', options: {id: 13, details: true}}
```

Use this in your top level component to determine which components should be
rendered based on the current route information.

### Link Component

To link directly to a route name, use the included `<Link/>` React component:

```js
export class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Edit Your Contacts</h1>
        <Link href="#edit-contacts" name="editContacts" options={{id: 13, details: true}}/>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

When the user clicks on the link a NAVIGATE event will be fired, and the user's
url will be updated to `/contacts/13/edit?details=true` because that's what
uniloc generated from the name and options.

## API Reference

### `init(store, [routes], [aliases])`

```js
import init from 'unirouter/init'
```

Initializes the router, fires an initial `NAVIGATE` event, and attaches a
popstate event handler.

#### Arguments

* `store` \(*Object*): The Redux store object, just as is passed to `<Provider>`
  with `react-redux`.

* [`routes`] \(*Object*): The [uniloc][uniloc] routes object, passed to the
  `uniloc()` function documented [here][uniloc-api].

* [`aliases`] \(*Object*): The [uniloc][uniloc] aliases object, passed to the
  `uniloc()` function documented [here][uniloc-api].

### `navigate({url, [source], [push = false], [replace = false]})`

```js
import {navigate} from 'unirouter/actions'
```

Fires a navigate event, which updates the route information in the state. It
also optionally pushes a history entry using pushState, or replaces the current
one using replaceState.

#### Payload

The payload can have the following properties:

* `url` \(*String*): The url (including the querystring) to navigate to.

* [`source`] \(*String*): The source of the event. Currently not used by the
  reducer, but may be in the future.

* [`push`] \(*Boolean*): Whether the browser url should be updated with
  pushState, adding a new history entry for the user.

* [`replace`] \(*Boolean*): Whether the browser url should be updated silently
  with replaceState, which doesn't add a new history entry.

### `configureRouter([routes], [aliases])`

```js
import {configureRouter} from 'unirouter/router'
```

Replaces the current singleton `uniloc` instance with a new one using the given
routes and aliases.

#### Arguments

* [`routes`] \(*Object*): The [uniloc][uniloc] routes object, passed to the
  `uniloc()` function documented [here][uniloc-api].

* [`aliases`] \(*Object*): The [uniloc][uniloc] aliases object, passed to the
  `uniloc()` function documented [here][uniloc-api].

### `<Link/>`

```js
import Link from 'unirouter/components/link'
```

A React component to provide links that will initiate navigation when clicked.

#### Props

* `href` \(*String*): The href to use for the `<a>` element.

* `name` \(*String*): The `uniloc` route name, which is passed to the
  `generate()` function documented [here][uniloc-api].

* [`options`] \(*Object*): The `uniloc` route options, which are passed to the
  `generate()` function documented [here][uniloc-api].
